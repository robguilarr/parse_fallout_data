    "# ⚙️🛠️ Parsing Data from player.txt files\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of how we extracted the data from the Fallout telemetry system. We count with a log file per player, where each line represents different actions, such as dialog actions, quests, and attack logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to write a script to parse and process the data and then convert it into a data frame. For this reason, we will divide this notebook into various sections as a way to demonstrate how we can transform the unstructured data from the **telemetry system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting let's check how the files are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "![files](Images/files.png \"Files\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Addtional Notes:\n",

    "#143  -> #191\n",
    "On Oct 27, I assigned #143 subject to #191 \n",
    "\n",
    "106 uses God mode \n",
    "\n",
    "127 and 113 seems to have extremely large range in introhouse location\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we see, this is not the most optimal way to allocate the data, since on a big scale the log info of a videogame should be stored in a database, not in folders, or in a Sharepoint like in the given example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how each .txt file looks inside:\n",
    "\n",
    "![text file](Images/Text.png \"Fines\")\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple records unstructured, in a log file per player, where each line represents different actions followed by attributes related to them. Like the next ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Shell\n",
    "['Position_Introhouse' 'Quest' 'Dialogue' 'ObjectOnActivate' 'InteractionObject' 'InteractionDoor' 'InteractionNPC'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Creature Giant Rat attacked first' 'InteractionContainer' 'Position_Outside' 'Position_Bar' 'InteractionInterior'\n",

    "\n",
    "'Player health: <no name>' 'Player killed' 'Player looted dead' 'PlayerEquipped' 'PlayerUnequipped' 'Stat']\n",
